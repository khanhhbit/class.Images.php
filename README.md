# class.Images.php

Yes, I know. It is yet another image manipulation class for PHP. But so far I haven’t found the one that really matches my needs. Either they are too complicated or bound to another system. So I simply created my own class with just the functions I need. So it’s the perfect class for me. If you like it, too – even better! Feel free to contribute and make it better.

*Please note:* This class has been developed some years ago. There are probably better solutions out there by now. If I ever find the time I might redo this class. In the meantime however, feel free to contribute and improve it.

### Basic example
Here’s a basic example of what you can do and this is what you’ll get with it.

	<?php
	include('../class.Images.php');
	
	//Create a new object, send relative or absolut path to your image
	$image = new Image('../test/image1.png');
	
	//We can rotate the image
	$image->rotate(90);
	
	//and we can resize and crop it to have a nice thumbnail
	$image->resize(150,150,'crop');
		
	//lets see what we have!
	$image->display();
